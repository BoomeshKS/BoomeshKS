- I treat every feature as a **mini product**: requirements → architecture → implementation → measurement.  
- I care about **performance metrics** (load time, response time, query efficiency) and not just “it works”.  
- I like **clean, reviewable code** with a structure that future developers can understand quickly.  
- I continually push myself towards **DevOps, Deep Learning, and NLP** to keep my work modern and impactful.
